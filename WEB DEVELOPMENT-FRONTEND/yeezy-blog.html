        <h2>Yeezy SZN APPROACHING</h2>
        <p>
            Kanye "Ye" West secretly unveiled his YEEZY SEASON 10 fashion show 
            in Los Angeles on May 1, an extremely low-key affair that barely revealed 
            any clothing or fashion designs at all. Instead, the focus was on a group of 
            skinhead models wearing skin-tight white T-shirts with black pants and little else.
            Ye quietly began working on YEEZY SEASON 10 in late April 2023, casting models with 
            shaved heads by way of a last-minute casting call at an LA warehouse.

            Considering the recent skin-tight thermal-style outfits that've 
            been uploaded by Ye's obsessive fan pages over the past few weeks, 
            we'd have assumed that Ye would've shown a more cohesive clothing selection.
            Even the disastrous YEEZY SEASON 9 show, rife as that was with looks 
            that never got produced, actually had plenty of "real" outfits.
